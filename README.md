# Task_Management_System
This is a simple task management system created using the Express, Node.JS, React and MongoDB (MERN) stack.

The following technologies are used:
MongoDB for database
Express and Node.JS for the backend API
React for the client

Running this Implementation
Start the NodeJS and Express Backend
Run 
npm i cors express mongoose
npm i -D nodemon

Nodemon will listen for file changes and automatically update the application without needing to restart. The server starts on port 4000.

Start the React Frontend
Run 
npm i react-router-dom axios antd recharts
Run
$ npm run dev
File changes will be picked automatically without the need to restart. The application starts on port 5173.
